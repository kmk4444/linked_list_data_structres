# linked_list_data_structres
Within the scope of this application, you write a program using the C programming language to keep the information of the fans of two different football teams waiting in line.

Our problem can be expressed as follows. Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray fans wait in separate lines to buy tickets. You need to define a separate linked list for each row. While identification number (id) and age (age) information are kept for Fenerbahçe fans, only identification numbers are kept for Galatasaray fans. Fenerbahçe fans are added to their lists in ascending order, while Galatasaray fans are added to their lists in descending order. The number of fans in both link lists will be the same.
